# Zoom Room Controls
QSC Q-SYS plugin for Zoom Room Controls JSON API. This plugin runs a TCP Server on a configurable port. Enter the expected commands on the left side of the plugin, and the corresponding button will be triggered when that command is received. Beause "\n" and "\r" are ignored from incoming data, the expected commands need no delimiters.
